# TheLeftPhalange
An Air Traffic Control Game as a single page Angular 2 application

Conventions:
I'm using C# conventions with 2 exceptions:
	Although method names are PascalCase, functions are camelCase
	Interfaces will not start with an I.
justification: althought I prefer interfaces to start with an I, this is not a typescript convention. In honour of the conventions of underlying javascript, stand alone functions are lower case. However, types classes with methods are borrowed from languages like c# and java and since the author of typescript was part of the c# team, I'm adopting c# conventions as a nod to its original inspiration.
